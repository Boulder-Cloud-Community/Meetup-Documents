<Name>,

Thank you for joining the Boulder Cloud Community meet-up group. We're a welcoming community of folks who gather to talk about cloud tools and culture in downtown Boulder.

I hope you'll join us Tuesday, <date> from 12:00 - 1:00 for the next meet-up.

To promote a welcoming community, the Boulder Cloud Community leadership team has adopted a
Code of Conduct (https://github.com/Boulder-Cloud-Community/Meetup-Documents/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

What questions can I answer for you?

Cheers,
